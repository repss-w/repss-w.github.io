                        <p></p>
                        
                        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                        <p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has shown significant potential in heart rate variability (HRV) estimation. HRV reflects more nuanced autonomic regulation than average heart rate and supports diverse applications, including autonomic function assessment, stress evaluation, and sleep monitoring. Accurate HRV estimation critically depends on recovering long-range, continuous, and high-quality blood volume pulse (BVP) signals from facial videos. This talk introduces a solution for generating high-quality BVP signals of flexible duration from facial videos for accurate HRV monitoring. The proposed method includes a global spatio-temporal modeling strategy for long-range physiological signals, combined with computational efficiency improvements achieved through progressive dimensionality reduction and sparse self-attention.
Finally, we will discuss the future trends of accurate HRV monitoring based on rPPG technology.</p>

                        <h3>Title: Towards real-world remote physiological signal measurement</h3>
                        <p></p>
                        
                        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                        <p>In recent years, remote physiological signal measurement has attracted significant attention due to its convenience and effectiveness. It has made substantial progress in applications such as invasive healthcare applications. However, when applied to complex real-world scenarios, the accuracy of the measurements is often challenged by two major factors: video degradation and domain shift on dynamic environments. As we know, real-world videos are typically affected by various forms of unknown and mixed degradation. Due to the subtle nature of physiological signals, they are particularly susceptible to interference from these degradations. It remains a critical challenge to enhance the robustness of physiological signal extraction under unknown degradation conditions. Meanwhile, real-world environments are highly dynamic and induce domain shift across diverse scenarios. In continuously changing dynamic scenarios, how to reduce the interference of domain shift on heart rate signal extraction, and how to leverage unlabeled data from new domains to improve the cross-domain adaptability of the models, are also pressing issues to be addressed. I will share the recent research works in my group to solve the above challenges and discuss the future trend.</p>
